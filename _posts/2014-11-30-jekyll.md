#1.Create a Post
Create posts easily via rake task:
	
	$ rake page name="about.md"
Create a nested page:
	
	$ rake page name="pages/about.md"
Create a page with a "pretty" path:
	
	$ rake page name="pages/about"
	# this will create the file: ./pages/about/index.html
The rake task automatically creates a page file with properly formatted filename and YAML Front Matter as well as includes the Jekyll Bootstrap "setup" file.

----------
#2.Publish
After you've added posts or made changes to your theme or other files, simply commit them to your git repo and push the commits up to GitHub.
	
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m "Add new content"
	$ git push origin master
